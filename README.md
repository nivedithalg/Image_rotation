# Image_rotation
This Python script rotates an image by a specified angle using the Pillow (PIL) library. The script supports RGBA images and ensures the entire rotated image fits within the new canvas size.
List key features:
   Rotates images by a given angle. Here i have used 45 degree
   Preserves transparency (RGBA support)
   Uses expand=True to prevent cropping
   Efficient implementation using Pillow
