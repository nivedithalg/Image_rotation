# Image_rotation
# This Python script rotates an image by a specified angle using the Pillow (PIL) library. The script supports RGBA images and ensures the entire rotated image fits within the new canvas size.
# List key features:
   1.Rotates images by a given angle. Here i have used 45 degree
   2.Preserves transparency (RGBA support)
   3.Uses expand=True to prevent cropping
   4.Efficient implementation using Pillow
